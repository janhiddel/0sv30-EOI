This is a list of most important concepts that have been discussed during the 0SV00 course. The list is
not encompassing all possible terms but is merely an indication. To pass exam every student should
know what these concepts mean and how to use them.

\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Bruntland definition of sustainable development}
Development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Intra-generational equity}
Equity within own generation
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Inter-generational equity}
Equity between generations, that is, including the needs of future generations in the design and implementation of current policies
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Neoliberalism}
Neoliberalism is a policy model of social studies and economics that transfers control of economic factors to the private sector from the public sector associated with a laissez-faire attitude, favouring free trade, privatization, minimal government intervention in business and more. 
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Common but differentiated responsibility principle}
The common but differentiated responsibilities principle establishes that all states are responsible for addressing global environmental destruction yet they are not equally responsible. The principle balances, on the one hand, the need for all states to take responsibility for global environmental problems and, on the other hand, the need to recognize the wide differences in levels of economic development between states. These differences in turn are linked to the statesâ€™ contributions to the problems as well as their abilities to address these problems. 
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Ecological modernization}
Ecological modernization is an optimistic school of thought in the social sciences that argues that the economy benefits from moves towards environmentalism. It is an analytical approach as well as a policy strategy. 
\end{sortEnvironment}

\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{LA21}
LA21, abbreviation for Local Agenda 21: the implementation of Agenda 21 was intended to involve action at international, national, regional and local levels. Some national and state governments have legislated or advised that local authorities take steps to implement the plan locally These programs are often known as "Local Agenda 21" or "LA21".
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{ICLEI}
ICLEI, abbreviation for International Council for Local Environmental Authorities, was founded in 1990 and is an international association of local governments and national and regional local government organizations that have made a commitment to sustainable development.

\\
Communism is a political and economic ideology based on the holding of all property in common, actual ownership being ascribed to the community as a whole or to the state.

\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Decoupling}
Decoupling is reducing the amount of physical emissions or natural resource use per unit of economic output. This can be achieved either trough increased efficiency, 'eco-efficiency', stemming from technological change, or a shift to less environmentally damaging products. 
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Precautionary principle}
The Precautionary Principle states that where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Polluter pays principle}
The 'polluters pays' principle is the commonly accepted practice that those who produce pollution should bear the costs of managing it to prevent damage to human health or the environment. For instance, a factory that produces a potentially poisonous substance as a byproduct of its activities is usually held responsible for its safe disposal. 
\end{sortEnvironment}

\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{De-growth / A-growth}
\textsc{De-growth} is a political, economic, and social movement based on ecological economics, anti-consumerist and anti-capitalist ideas.

These pathways and mechanisms explicitly advocate equity and recognize the need for redistribution of the Earth's resources in order for human society to operate enduringly within the Earth's biophysical limits. 
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Baker's ladder of sustainable development}
\textsc{Pollution control:} environmental protection is important, but should not put limits on development or constrain human freedom to innovate. Technology can solve any environmental problem. Provides Environmental Kuznets Curve as evidence.\\
\\
\textsc{Weak sustainable development:} economic approach to sustainable development. Pricing is important for natural resources: best way to preserve them. Strong belief in technological substitutes. Ecological modernization: economy benefits from environment. Policies promoting economic growth. \\
\\
\textsc{Strong sustainable development:} environment a pre-condition for development, not the other way around. Limits to technological fixes. Shift from growth to non-material aspects of development. Attention to development in other world regions. From quantitative GDP to qualitative HDI and quality of life. \\
\\
\textsc{Ideal sustainable development:} attributes equal value to all life forms. Non-interference with nature. Rejects managerial interference in nature. Laborintensive technologies. Bottom up community structures 
\end{sortEnvironment}

\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Catch-up idea}
The idea that the Third World should â€˜catch upâ€™ with the developed world. Important for the conventional development model: necessary for Third World societies to â€˜catch upâ€™ with the Western style of development. This means opening up their economies to Western values,
influences, investment and trade, thereby becoming more integrated into the global market system.
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Rostow's model of development}
In the conventional model, society is understood to go through different â€˜stages of economic growthâ€™ (Rostow, 1960). Traditional societies develop to a stage of economic â€˜take-offâ€™. This sees new industries and entrepreneurial classes emerge. In â€˜maturityâ€™, steady economic growth outstrips population growth. A â€˜final stageâ€™ is reached when high mass consumption allows the emergence of social welfare. This model of development assumes a linear progression and is highly criticized.  
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Grassroots movement}
A grassroots movement (often referenced in the context of a political movement) is one which uses the people in a given district as the basis for a political or economic movement. Grassroots movements and organizations use collective action from the local level to effect change. Grassroots movements are associated with bottom-up and are sometimes considered more natural than traditional power structures.
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Bottom-up / top-down}
\textsc{A bottom-up} approach to changes one that works from the grassrootsâ€”from a large number of people working together, causing a decision to arise from their joint involvement. A decision by a number of activists, students, or victims of some incident to take action is a "bottom-up" decision. A bottom-up approach can be thought of as "an incremental change approach that represents an emergent process cultivated and upheld primarily by frontline workers" 
\textsc{A top-down} approach is where an executive decision maker or other top person makes the decisions of how something should be done. This approach is disseminated under their authority to lower levels in the hierarchy, who are, to a greater or lesser extent, bound by them.
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Rio Earth Summit}
The Rio Earth Summit was a major United Nations conference held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.

Non-governmental organizations are international organizations and generally nonprofit organizations independent of specific governments (though often funded by governments) that are active in humanitarian, educational, healthcare, public policy, social, human rights, environmental, and other areas to effect changes according to their objectives. They are thus a subgroup of all organizations founded by citizens, which include clubs and other associations that provide services, benefits, and premises only to members.
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Limits to growth}
The Limits to Growth is a 1972 book about the computer simulation of exponential economic and population growth with finite resource supplies. The book used a model to simulate the consequence of interactions between the Earth's and human systems. The original version presented a model based on five variables: world population, industrialization, pollution, food production and resources depletion. These variables are considered to grow exponentially, while the ability of technology to increase resources is only linear. The purpose of The Limits to Growth was not to make specific predictions, but to explore how exponential growth interacts with finite resources. Because the size of resources is not known, only the general behavior can be explored.
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Malthus}
Thomas Malthus (1766 -1834) was a political economist and Enlightenment thinker who observed the growing population with increasing concern. To explain poverty, dearth and famine he wrote a famous essay at the end of the 18th century entitled An Essay on the Principle of Population.

The ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic (i.e., human-induced) interference with the climate system.
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{UNFCCC / COP}
\textsc{The United Nations Climate Change Conferences (UNFCC)} are yearly conferences held in the framework of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). They serve as the formal meeting of the UNFCCC Parties (Conference of the Parties, COP) to assess progress in dealing with climate change, and beginning in the mid-1990s, to negotiate the Kyoto Protocol to establish legally binding obligations for developed countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. \\
\\
\textsc{COP} is the supreme decision-making body of the Convention.

\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Deep ecology}
Deep ecology is a somewhat recent branch of ecological philosophy (ecosophy) that considers humankind as an integral part of its environment. The philosophy emphasizes the interdependent value of human and non-human life as well as the importance of the ecosystem and natural processes. It provides a foundation for the environmental and green movements and has led to a new system of environmental ethics. Deep ecology's core principle is the claim that, like humanity, the living environment as a whole has the same right to live and flourish.
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{IMF}
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international organization of "189 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world", formed in 1945 it came into existence with the goal of reconstructing the international payment system.

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Kyoto Protocol}
The Kyoto Protocol is an international treaty which extends the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that commits State Parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on the scientific consensus that (a) global warming is occurring and (b) it is extremely likely that human-made CO2 emissions have predominantly caused it. There are currently 192 parties (Canada withdrew). The Kyoto Protocol implemented the objective of the UNFCCC to fight global warming by reducing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere to "a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system". The Protocol is based on the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities: it puts the obligation to reduce current emissions on developed countries on the basis that they are historically responsible for the current levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
\end{sortEnvironment}

\begin{sortEnvironment}{Rio Earth Summit}
The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), also known as the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit was a major United Nations conference in 1992.
